Repetendus erit, nec taedia coepti ulla mei capiam, dum spiritus iste manebit. Nam primum, si facta mihi revocare liceret, non coepisse fuit: coepta expugnare secundum est.

I will try again, and not suffer any weariness in my attempts, while breath is left to me. Since I cannot undo my actions, it would have been best not to begin: but, having begun, the next best is to win through.

Ovid, Metamorphoses 9.615
